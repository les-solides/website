		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			Established in 2018, les solides is a multidisciplinary creative project. Founded by Anna Z’Brun, they
			create timeless pieces that are produced locally in Bali and remain detached from the seasons of the fashion
			industry. Anna Z’Brun sees her label as a counterpoint to mass consumption and fast pace, she relies on minimal
			and timeless design. Far from binary gender roles, their designs work for everyone, focusing on craftsmanship,
			technique, and sustainable fabrication. The brand presents a hybrid practice that is guided by a strong emphasis
			on experimentation and collaboration translated through a fluid merging of reference. les solides wants to use
			the wisdom of many, not only the intelligence of a few.
